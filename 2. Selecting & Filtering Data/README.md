## 2️⃣ Selecting & Filtering Data

In this section, we focus on one of the most important pandas skills:
**how to select, filter, and modify data efficiently.**

We will cover the following subsections:

### **1️⃣ `loc` and `iloc`**

* Selecting rows and columns by **label** using `.loc`
* Selecting rows and columns by **position** using `.iloc`
* Selecting single rows, ranges, and specific cells
* Mixing row and column selection

---

### **2️⃣ Boolean Indexing**

* Filtering rows based on conditions
* Using logical operations: `&`, `|`, `~`
* Filtering with string conditions
* Creating reusable boolean masks

---

### **3️⃣ Multi-Condition Filtering**

* Combining multiple conditions
* Filtering with `.isin()`
* Filtering using string methods like `.str.contains()`
* Handling NaN values during filtering

---

### **4️⃣ Setting & Updating Values**

* Modifying values using `.loc` and `.iloc`
* Conditional value updates
* Replacing values using `.replace()`
* Changing multiple rows/columns at once
* Safely updating a subset of data
