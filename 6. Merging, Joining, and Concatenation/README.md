# 🟦 **Section 6 — Merging, Joining, and Concatenation**

In this section, you will learn how to **combine multiple DataFrames** — one of the most essential skills in data analysis. Pandas provides powerful tools for relational-style joins, SQL-like merges, and stacking data vertically or horizontally.

This section covers practical and advanced usage of:

* 🔗 `merge()`
* 🧱 `concat()`
* 🔄 Index-based joins (`join()`)

You will learn how to combine datasets in ways similar to SQL, databases, and relational data modeling.

## 🟦 **Subsections in This Section**

### **6.1 Understanding Merge Types (Inner, Left, Right, Outer)**

You will learn:

* What each merge type means
* How pandas aligns rows during merge
* The difference between matching keys and unmatched keys
* Visual examples similar to SQL joins

---

### **6.2 Using `merge()` in Pandas**

You will learn how to:

* Merge on one or multiple key columns
* Merge with different column names on each side
* Control suffixes when column names overlap
* Perform advanced merges (many-to-one, many-to-many)

---

### **6.3 Concatenation with `pd.concat()`**

You will learn how to:

* Stack DataFrames vertically (rows)
* Stack DataFrames horizontally (columns)
* Handle different columns during concatenation
* Control index alignment with `ignore_index`
* Concatenate in a loop (real-world use case)

---

### **6.4 Index-Based Joins (`DataFrame.join()`)**

You will learn how to:

* Join DataFrames based on their index
* Align indexes automatically
* Compare `join()` vs `merge()`
* Use left, right, inner, outer joins based on index

## 🟦 **What You’ll Be Able to Do After This Section**

✔ Combine multiple datasets efficiently
✔ Perform SQL-style joins in pandas
✔ Append data from multiple files or tables
✔ Use index alignment to your advantage
✔ Understand the difference between merge, join, and concat
