# 📘 **7️⃣ Pivot Tables & Reshaping**

Data reshaping is one of the most powerful parts of pandas.
This section teaches you how to transform your DataFrame between **wide** and **long** formats, summarize data using pivot tables, and restructure multi-level indexes.

## 🟦 **What You Will Learn in This Section**

### **7.1 Pivot Tables with `pivot_table()`**

You will learn how to:

* Create pivot tables similar to Excel
* Summarize data using aggregations (sum, mean, count, etc.)
* Pivot with multiple index and column levels
* Handle missing values with `fill_value`

---

### **7.2 Reshaping with `melt()` (Wide → Long Format)**

You will learn how to:

* Convert wide-format tables into long format
* Control variable and value column names
* Reshape time-series or measurement datasets
* Handle multiple value columns

---

### **7.3 Reshaping with `pivot()` (Long → Wide Format)**

You will learn:

* The difference between `pivot` and `pivot_table`
* How to widen long-format data
* How to handle situations where pivot fails due to duplicates

---

### **7.4 MultiIndex Reshaping with `stack()` & `unstack()`**

You will learn how to:

* Convert columns into index levels (`stack`)
* Convert index levels into columns (`unstack`)
* Understand hierarchical indexes
* Work with partially stacked / unstacked structures
